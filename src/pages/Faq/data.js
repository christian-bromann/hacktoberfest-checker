        question: "Why do some PRs have 'Pending' next to them?",
        answer: "There is a grace period this year which means that a PR must be open (or merged) for a couple of days in order to give maintainers the chance to mark issues as invalid. This avoids the scenario where a PR is opened to make it count in the Hackathon and then it gets closed."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do some PRs show outside the hackathon period?",
        answer: "We are humans, we are not perfect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There is a chance of a PR being counted it counting if it is in the hackathon period in any timezone."
